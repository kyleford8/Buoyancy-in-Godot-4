# Surfing Game - Godot 4

A minimally viable surfing game prototype built in Godot 4 with realistic wave physics and surfing mechanics.

## Features

### üåä Surfable Waves
- Realistic Gerstner wave equations for authentic surfing physics
- Multiple wave layers with different frequencies and directions
- Dynamic wave height and steepness parameters
- Infinite water system with seamless tiling

### üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Surfing Mechanics
- Wave gradient detection for automatic wave riding
- Balance controls with mouse/touch input
- Air time tracking for tricks and stunts
- Speed-based scoring system
- Trick scoring with air time bonuses

### üéÆ Game Features
- Real-time UI showing score, speed, and wave status
- Objective system with progressive challenges
- Dynamic camera that follows surfing action
- 5-minute time limit with scoring objectives
- Trick detection and scoring

## Controls

- **Mouse/Touch Drag**: Balance and steer the surfboard
- **WASD**: Alternative keyboard controls for movement
- **Space**: Jump/boost (for tricks)

## Objectives

1. **First Wave**: Ride your first wave for 5 seconds (100 points)
2. **Speed Demon**: Reach 100 km/h speed (200 points)
3. **Air Time**: Stay airborne for 2 seconds (300 points)
4. **Score Master**: Reach 1000 points (500 points)

## Technical Implementation

### Wave System
- Uses Gerstner wave equations for realistic water displacement
- Multiple wave layers create complex, surfable wave patterns
- Infinite water tiling system for seamless exploration
- Real-time wave height calculation for physics interaction

### Physics
- RigidBody3D with custom buoyancy forces
- Wave gradient detection for surfing mechanics
- Air time tracking for trick detection
- Speed-based camera adjustments

### Game Loop
- Objective-based progression system
- Real-time scoring and UI updates
- Dynamic camera following
- Time-limited gameplay sessions

## Files Structure

- `assets/shaders/water.gdshader` - Enhanced water shader with Gerstner waves
